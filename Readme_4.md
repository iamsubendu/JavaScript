Mutabile vs Immutable
In programming, mutability refers to whether or not an object can be changed
after it's been created. If an object can be modified (e.g., its contents can be
changed, added to, or removed), it is said to be mutable. If an object cannot
be modified after its creation, it is considered immutable.
