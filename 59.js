// Prototype & Prototypal Inheritance

let arr = ["Sub", "Subh"];
let length = arr.length;
// when we use .,we get list of pre-defined methods to use

// Due to protoype, we get access to these hidden properties

// whenever we create object/array or function etc, JS
// attaches another object to our original object.
// so, that how we have access to pre-defined methods
